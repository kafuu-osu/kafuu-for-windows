## To build a server on your own windows computer, you need:

0. Environment: mysql 5.7, Python3.6+, redis, a source code

1. Start nginx locally

2. A switch that directs the server address to the local

3. Start bancho

4. Start osu!

## Two startup methods:

1. Use KafuuLocal client: you can access osu.ppy.sh normally (you need to put it in the osu directory to run)
2. Using osu! Client: Cannot access osu.ppy.sh
